types 
primitive types
strings
numbers
booleans
null
undefined
symbol

Reference types
object
array
functions
dates 

strings
var str = 'hello world'
var myString = 'hello world'
var myString = "hello world"
var myString = `hello world`

you can also grab the length of a string
str.length
myString.length

numbers
var num = 10
var myNum = 10
var myNum = 10.5
var myNum = 10.5;

myNum * 'hello world'
 NaN 
  you also have 
  positive infinity
  negative infinity

  primitive types
  BigInt 
  num.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
  num.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER

  bigInt are use when working with large nums

  Booleans types 
  true
  false
  
  Booleans are used to represent true or false values
  true and false are primitive types
  true is true 
  false is false


  null
   null is a primitive type
   null is used to represent to keep any value empty 
   null is not a reference type

   undefined
    undefined is a primitive type
    undefined is used to represent the absence of any value

    symbol
     symbol is a primitive type
     symbol is used to represent a unique identifier
     symbol is not a reference type
     symbol();

   data primitive types
     strings
     number
     boolean
      null
      undefined
      symbol

      #reference types
       object
       array  
       function

       object
        var obj = {} -- this is refers to as and object literal
        obj.name = 'joe'
        obj.age = 10
        obj.isMale = true
        obj.hobbies = ['reading', 'coding', video games']
        obj.hobbies.push('playing')
        obj.hobbies.push('sleeping')
        console.log(obj)


now to build  a person object 
const person = {
  name: 'joe',
  age: 10,
  job: 'developer',
  hobbies: ['reading', 'coding', 'video games'],--has an array of nested objects
}

# arrays
a collection of values of items etc.
const people = ['joe', 'andrew', 'guy']
 
you can also use the typeOf operator to check the type of array 
 e.g typeOf people---object
 typeOf person---object

 reference types are also refers to as objects as well 
 that is its returns object

 # functions
 a function is a block of code that can be called and executed
  functions are used to perform a specific task
  define a function
  declare a function
  call a function
   function sayHi() {console.log('hi')}
    sayHi()

    typeOf sayHi()---it returns as a function type

    functions are also objects 
    e.g  date = new Date()
    date.getDate()
    typeOf date---object
 new Date()
 new Date().getDate()

 # dates
 a date is a specific point in time
 you can use the Date() constructor to create a date object
const date = new Date()
date.getDate()
date.getMonth()
date.getFullYear()
